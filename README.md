# `<model-viewer>` codelab

This is the starting template for a codelab giving a brief introduction to
enhancing web pages with 3D content. Give it a try!

The codelab will take you through a few steps to take a basic HTML file
(`index.html`) through adding a 3D model, and gradually adding more
interactivity and changing how it looks.

# 3D models

We've included a few 3D models in the repo for you to try. Many more are
available on sites like [Poly](https://poly.google.com) and
[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com).
